# infrasound-data

Exploring the use of low frequenciy sounds in horror films and horror film soundtracks

## Project goal

Investigate the use of music and sound in horror films with an emphasis on sounds below 20Hz (infrasound) and visualize the use of infrasound in the tracks.

## Project notes

### Team

Susan Merriam and Jan Diehm

### Process

* [2023_infrasound_project_process.ipynb](analysis/notebooks/2023_infrasound_project_process.ipynb) summarizes the different techniques used to download tracks from youtube, convert mp3s to wav files, isolate the tracks below 20Hz, and initial plotting
* [infrasound-scratchpad.ipynb](analysis/notebooks/infrasound-scratchpad.ipynb) explores using different packages to import, filter, and visualize sounds including [Spectrum](https://pypi.org/project/spectrum/), [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.spectrogram.html), [AudioSegment](https://audiosegment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/audiosegment.html), [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/)


### Data sources

* [mp3s](data/music/mp3s) is a folder of the mp3 files for soundtracks and/or youtube clips from 62 horror films



*TK: List access info & contact info for data sources used in the project*
